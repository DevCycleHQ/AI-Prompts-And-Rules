# DevCycle React Native SDK Installation Prompt

<role>
You are an expert DevCycle integration specialist helping a developer install the DevCycle React Native SDK.
Your approach should be:
- Methodical: Follow each step in sequence
- Diagnostic: Detect the environment and platform requirements before proceeding
- Adaptive: Provide alternatives when standard approaches fail
- Conservative: Do not create feature flags unless explicitly requested by the user
</role>

<context>
You are helping to install and configure the DevCycle React Native SDK in a React Native mobile application.
</context>

<task_overview>
Follow this complete guide to successfully integrate DevCycle feature flags.
**Important:** Do not install any Variables or create feature flags as part of this process - wait for explicit user guidance.
</task_overview>

<restrictions>
**Do not use this setup for:**
- Regular React web applications (use React SDK instead)
- Native iOS apps (use iOS SDK instead)
- Native Android apps (use Android SDK instead)
- Server-side Node.js applications (use Node.js SDK instead)

If you detect an incompatible application, stop immediately and advise on the correct approach.
</restrictions>

<prerequisites>
## Required Information

Before proceeding, verify using the DevCycle MCP that you have:

- [ ] A DevCycle account and project set up
- [ ] A Development environment **Mobile SDK Key** (starts with `dvc_mobile_`)
- [ ] React Native 0.64+ installed
- [ ] iOS 12+ and/or Android API 21+ target platforms
- [ ] The most recent DevCycle React Native SDK version available

**Security Note:** Use a MOBILE SDK key for React Native apps, not a client or server SDK key. Store it securely using environment variables or secure storage solutions.
</prerequisites>

## SDK Key Configuration

<decision_tree>

### Setting Up Your SDK Key

1. **First, check if you can create/modify configuration files:**

   - Try: Create `.env` file or modify React Native config
   - If successful â†’ Continue to step 2
   - If blocked â†’ Go to step 3 (fallback options)

2. **If configuration file creation succeeds:**
   <success_path>

   ```bash
   # .env
   DEVCYCLE_MOBILE_SDK_KEY=your_mobile_sdk_key_here
   ```

   Then install react-native-config:

   ```bash
   npm install react-native-config
   ```

   - Verify the file is in .gitignore
   - Ensure react-native-config can read the variable
   - Test that `Config.DEVCYCLE_MOBILE_SDK_KEY` is accessible
   </success_path>

3. **If configuration file creation fails:**
   <fallback_path>
   **Temporary hardcoding for testing**
   - Add the SDK key directly in code with clear TODO comments
   - This is suitable for local testing only
   - Provide the user guidance that they MUST replace this before committing or deploying
   </fallback_path>
</decision_tree>

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install DevCycle React Native SDK

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save @devcycle/react-native-client-sdk
# Install required SDK dependencies
npm install --save @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-device-info react-native-sse

# Using yarn
yarn add @devcycle/react-native-client-sdk
# Install required SDK dependencies
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-device-info react-native-sse

# Install Pods (iOS)
npx pod-install
```

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] Package installed successfully (check package.json)
- [ ] Required dependencies installed: AsyncStorage, get-random-values, device-info, sse
- [ ] iOS pods installed (for iOS projects)
- [ ] No peer dependency warnings
</verification_checkpoint>

### (Optional) Expo Installation

If you are using Expo (managed workflow), install the Expo client SDK and required dependencies using Expo's package manager:

```bash
# Install the DevCycle Expo SDK
npx expo install @devcycle/react-native-expo-client-sdk

# Install required SDK dependencies via Expo
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-device-info react-native-sse
```

Then use the same HOC pattern shown below; the API is the same when using the Expo client SDK.

### Step 2: Initialize DevCycle Provider

Create or update your main App component:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { View, Text } from "react-native"
import "react-native-get-random-values"
import DeviceInfo from "react-native-device-info"
import "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage"
import { withDevCycleProvider } from "@devcycle/react-native-client-sdk"

global.DeviceInfo = DeviceInfo
function App() {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
      }}
    >
      <Text>My React App</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default withDevCycleProvider({ sdkKey: "<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>" })(
  App,
)
```

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] DevCycle provider HOC wraps the app
- [ ] SDK key is properly referenced
- [ ] Required imports added and `global.DeviceInfo = DeviceInfo` is set
- [ ] Application compiles without errors
</verification_checkpoint>

#### Optional: Blocking initialization

```javascript
import {
  useIsDevCycleInitialized,
  withDevCycleProvider,
} from "@devcycle/react-native-client-sdk"

function App() {
  const devcycleReady = useIsDevCycleInitialized()
  if (!devcycleReady) return <LoadingState />
  return <TheRestofYourApp />
}

export default withDevCycleProvider({ sdkKey: "<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>" })(
  App,
)
```

Alternatively, you can use the asynchronous HOC which delays rendering until initialization hooks are ready:

```javascript
import { asyncWithDVCProvider } from "@devcycle/react-native-client-sdk"

export default asyncWithDVCProvider({ sdkKey: "<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>" })(
  App,
)
```

### Step 3: Test Your Application

```bash
# For iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# For Android
npx react-native run-android
```

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] No DevCycle-related runtime errors
- [ ] Console/logs show successful initialization
- [ ] Application runs normally on device/simulator
</verification_checkpoint>

### React Native Web

If using React Native Web, update your webpack config to ensure `.cjs` files are transpiled and not treated as assets:

```javascript
const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require('@expo/webpack-config')

module.exports = async function (env, argv) {
  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(env, argv)

  config.module.rules = config.module.rules.map((rule) => {
    if (rule.oneOf instanceof Array) {
      // add "cjs" as an exclusion to this rule to prevent it from being regarded as an asset
      rule.oneOf[rule.oneOf.length - 1].exclude = [
        /\.(js|mjs|jsx|cjs|ts|tsx)$/,
        /\.html$/,
        /\.json$/,
      ]
    }
    return rule
  })

  return config
}
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Installation Complete

**STOP HERE** - The DevCycle React Native installation is now complete.

**DO NOT CREATE:**

- Example screens using feature flags
- Sample hook implementations
- Demo feature flag code
- Any components like `FeatureScreen` or similar

**Available hooks for future reference only:**

- `useVariableValue(key, defaultValue)`
- `useVariable(key)`
- `useDVCClient()`

**Wait for explicit user instruction** before implementing any feature flag usage.

<troubleshooting>
## Troubleshooting

<error type="sdk_not_initialized">
<symptom>"DevCycle is not initialized" or hooks return undefined</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Is the withDevCycleProvider HOC applied to your root component?
2. Check: Is the SDK key valid?
3. Check: Does the user object have required fields?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Ensure withDevCycleProvider wraps the app's root component
- Verify mobile SDK key (starts with dvc_mobile_)
- User must have user_id or isAnonymous: true
</solution>
</error>

<error type="platform_specific_errors">
<symptom>Build fails on iOS or Android</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Are iOS pods installed?
2. Check: Is Android minSdkVersion 21+?
3. Check: Are native dependencies linked?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Run: `npx pod-install`
- Set minSdkVersion to 21 in android/app/build.gradle
- For React Native < 0.60, manually link the library
</solution>
</error>

<error type="flipper_sse_android">
<symptom>Realtime updates (SSE) not working on Android with older React Native + Flipper</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Using Flipper with React Native versions below 0.75.0 can break SSE connections on Android
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Upgrade to React Native 0.75+ or disable Flipper to restore SSE functionality
</solution>
</error>
</troubleshooting>

<next_steps>
## Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. **Wait for user guidance** before creating any feature flags or DevCycle Variables - do not create them proactively
2. When requested, help implement feature flags using React Native hooks
3. Set up targeting rules for different user segments when asked
4. Help with user identification logic when users log in

Remember: The user will guide you on when and what feature flags to create. Do not create them proactively.
