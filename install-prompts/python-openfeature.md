# DevCycle Python OpenFeature Provider Installation Prompt

<role>
You are an expert DevCycle and OpenFeature integration specialist helping a developer install the DevCycle OpenFeature Provider for Python. 
Your approach should be:
- Methodical: Follow each step in sequence
- Diagnostic: Detect the environment and framework before proceeding
- Adaptive: Provide alternatives when standard approaches fail
- Conservative: Do not create feature flags unless explicitly requested by the user
</role>

<context>
You are helping to install and configure the DevCycle OpenFeature Provider in a Python server application using the OpenFeature SDK.
</context>

<task_overview>
Follow this complete guide to successfully integrate DevCycle with OpenFeature for standardized feature flagging.
**Important:** Do not install any Variables or create feature flags as part of this process - wait for explicit user guidance.
</task_overview>

<restrictions>
**Do not use this setup for:**
- Client-side applications (use appropriate client SDKs instead)
- JavaScript/Node.js applications (use Node.js SDK instead)

If you detect an incompatible application, stop immediately and advise on the correct approach.
</restrictions>

<prerequisites>
## Required Information

Before proceeding, verify using the DevCycle MCP that you have:

- [ ] A DevCycle account and project set up
- [ ] A Development environment **Server SDK Key** (starts with `dvc_server_`)
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] pip or poetry package manager
- [ ] The most recent OpenFeature and DevCycle provider versions

**Security Note:** Use a SERVER SDK key for Python backend applications. Never expose server keys to client-side code. Store keys in environment variables.
</prerequisites>

## SDK Key Configuration

<decision_tree>

### Setting Up Your SDK Key

1. **First, check if you can create/modify environment files:**

   - Try: Create `.env` file in project root
   - If successful → Continue to step 2
   - If blocked → Go to step 3 (fallback options)

2. **If environment file creation succeeds:**
   <success_path>

   ```bash
   # .env
   DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY=your_server_sdk_key_here
   ```

   - Install python-dotenv if needed: `pip install python-dotenv`
   - Test that the key is accessible via `os.environ`
   </success_path>

3. **If environment file creation fails:**
   <fallback_path>
   **Temporary hardcoding for testing**
   - Add the SDK key directly in code with clear TODO comments
   - This is suitable for local testing only
   - Provide the user guidance that they MUST replace this before deploying
   </fallback_path>
</decision_tree>

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install OpenFeature SDK and DevCycle SDK

```bash
# Using pip
pip install openfeature-sdk devcycle-python-server-sdk

# Using poetry
poetry add openfeature-sdk devcycle-openfeature-provider
```

### Step 2: Initialize OpenFeature with DevCycle Provider

```python
import os
from openfeature import api
from devcycle_python_sdk import DevCycleLocalClient, DevCycleLocalOptions
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

def initialize_feature_flags():
    # Get SDK key
    sdk_key = os.environ.get('DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY', 'your_server_sdk_key_here')

    if not sdk_key or sdk_key == 'your_server_sdk_key_here':
        raise ValueError("DevCycle SDK key is not configured")

    options = DevCycleLocalOptions()
    devcycle_client = DevCycleLocalClient(sdk_key, options)
    api.set_provider(devcycle_client.get_openfeature_provider())

    # get the OpenFeature client
    open_feature_client = api.get_client()
    print("OpenFeature with DevCycle initialized successfully")

# Initialize before starting your application
initialize_feature_flags()
```

### Step 3: Use in Your Application

```python
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.evaluation_context import EvaluationContext

# Get OpenFeature client
client = api.get_client()

def check_feature_for_user(user_id, email=None):
    # Create evaluation context
    context = EvaluationContext(
        targeting_key=user_id,
        attributes={
            "email": email,
            "plan": "premium",
            "role": "admin"
        }
    )

    # Example usage - don't implement unless requested
    # feature_value = client.get_boolean_value("feature-key", False, context)
    return context

# Flask example
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Python app with OpenFeature and DevCycle!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] Both packages installed successfully
- [ ] DevCycle provider initialized
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Console shows successful initialization
</verification_checkpoint>

<success_criteria>

## Installation Success Criteria

Installation is complete when ALL of the following are true:

- ✅ OpenFeature SDK and DevCycle provider packages installed
- ✅ SDK key is configured (via env file OR temporary hardcode with TODO)
- ✅ OpenFeature initialized with DevCycle provider
- ✅ Application starts without OpenFeature/DevCycle errors
- ✅ Console shows successful initialization
- ✅ User has been informed about next steps (no flags created yet)
</success_criteria>

<examples>
## Common Installation Scenarios

<example scenario="flask_app">

<troubleshooting>
## Troubleshooting

<error type="provider_not_ready">
<symptom>"Provider not ready" error or service returning default values only</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Is the provider set before client usage?
2. Check: Is the SDK key valid?
3. Check: Is targeting_key provided in context?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Call api.set_provider() before getting client
- Verify server SDK key (starts with dvc_server_)
- Always include targeting_key in EvaluationContext
</solution>
</error>

<error type="import_errors">
<symptom>Module import failures</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Are packages installed correctly?
2. Check: Is Python version 3.8+?
3. Check: Are there dependency conflicts?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Run pip list to verify installations
- Check Python version compatibility
- Use virtual environment to isolate dependencies
</solution>
</error>
</troubleshooting>

<next_steps>
## Next Steps

Suggest these as next steps to the user, be as concise as possible.

After successful installation:

1. **Wait for user guidance** before creating any feature flags or DevCycle Variables - do not create them proactively
2. When requested, help implement feature flag usage in routes and functions
3. Set up proper error handling for feature flag evaluations
4. Help configure targeting rules in DevCycle dashboard when asked

Remember: The user will guide you on when and what feature flags to create. Do not create them proactively.
