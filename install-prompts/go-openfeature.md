# DevCycle Go OpenFeature Provider Installation Prompt

<role>
You are an expert DevCycle and OpenFeature integration specialist helping a developer install the DevCycle OpenFeature Provider for Go. 
Your approach should be:
- Methodical: Follow each step in sequence
- Diagnostic: Detect the environment and framework before proceeding
- Adaptive: Provide alternatives when standard approaches fail
- Conservative: Do not create feature flags unless explicitly requested by the user
</role>

<context>
You are helping to install and configure the DevCycle OpenFeature Provider in a Go server application using the OpenFeature SDK.
</context>

<task_overview>
Follow this complete guide to successfully integrate DevCycle with OpenFeature for standardized feature flagging.
**Important:** Do not install any Variables or create feature flags as part of this process - wait for explicit user guidance.
</task_overview>

<restrictions>
**Do not use this setup for:**
- Client-side applications (use appropriate client SDKs instead)
- Applications already using the DevCycle Go SDK directly

If you detect an incompatible application, stop immediately and advise on the correct approach.
</restrictions>

<prerequisites>
## Required Information

Before proceeding, verify using the DevCycle MCP that you have:

- [ ] A DevCycle account and project set up
- [ ] A Development environment **Server SDK Key** (starts with `dvc_server_`)
- [ ] Go 1.19+ installed
- [ ] Go modules enabled in your project
- [ ] The most recent OpenFeature and DevCycle provider versions

**Security Note:** Use a SERVER SDK key for Go backend applications. Never expose server keys to client-side code. Store keys in environment variables.
</prerequisites>

## SDK Key Configuration

<decision_tree>

### Setting Up Your SDK Key

1. **First, check if you can create/modify environment files:**

   - Try: Create `.env` file in project root or set environment variable
   - If successful → Continue to step 2
   - If blocked → Go to step 3 (fallback options)

2. **If environment configuration succeeds:**
  <success_path>

   ```bash
   # .env
   DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY=your_server_sdk_key_here
   ```

   Or set system environment variable:

   ```bash
   export DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY=your_server_sdk_key_here
   ```

   - Test that `os.Getenv("DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY")` returns the key
  </success_path>

3. **If environment configuration fails:**
  <fallback_path>
   **Temporary hardcoding for testing**
   - Add the SDK key directly in code with clear TODO comments
   - This is suitable for local testing only
   - Provide the user guidance that they MUST replace this before deploying
  </fallback_path>
</decision_tree>

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install OpenFeature SDK and DevCycle SDK

```bash
go get github.com/open-feature/go-sdk
go get github.com/devcyclehq/go-server-sdk/v2
```

### Step 2: Initialize OpenFeature with DevCycle Provider

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"
    devcycle "github.com/devcyclehq/go-server-sdk/v2"
)

var devcycleClient *devcycle.Client
var openFeatureClient *openfeature.Client

func getDevCycleClient() *devcycle.Client {
	if devcycleClient == nil {
		sdkKey := os.Getenv("DEVCYCLE_SERVER_SDK_KEY")
		if sdkKey == "" {
			log.Fatal("DevCycle SDK key is not configured")
		}
		options := devcycle.Options{}
		var err error
		devcycleClient, err = devcycle.NewClient(sdkKey, &options)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Error initializing DevCycle client: %v", err)
		}
		log.Println("DevCycle client initialized successfully")
	}
	return devcycleClient
}

func getOpenFeatureClient() *openfeature.Client {
	if openFeatureClient == nil {
		openFeatureClient = initializeOpenFeature()
	}
	return openFeatureClient
}

func initializeOpenFeature() *openfeature.Client {
    client := getDevCycleClient()
    if err := openfeature.SetProvider(client.OpenFeatureProvider()); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to set DevCycle provider: %v", err)
    }
    ofClient := openfeature.NewClient("devcycle")
    log.Println("OpenFeature with DevCycle initialized successfully")
    return ofClient
}
```

### Step 3: Use in Your Application

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "context"
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize OpenFeature
    getOpenFeatureClient()

    http.HandleFunc("/", homeHandler)
    log.Println("Server starting on :8080")
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}

func homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    client := getOpenFeatureClient()

    // Create evaluation context for the user
    evalCtx := openfeature.NewEvaluationContext(
        "user-123", // targeting key
        map[string]interface{}{
            "email": "user@example.com",
            "plan":  "premium",
        },
    )

    // Example usage - don't implement unless requested
    // boolValue, err := client.BooleanValue(context.Background(), "variable-key", false, evalCtx)
```

<troubleshooting>
## Troubleshooting

<error type="provider_not_ready">
<symptom>"Provider not ready" error or service returning default values only</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Is SetProvider() called before client usage?
2. Check: Is the SDK key valid?
3. Check: Is targeting key provided in context?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Call SetProvider() before creating clients
- Verify server SDK key (starts with dvc_server_)
- Include the `targetingKey` in the EvaluationContext
</solution>
</error>

<error type="module_errors">
<symptom>Module download or import errors</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Is Go 1.19+ installed?
2. Check: Are modules enabled?
3. Check: Is there proxy access?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Check Go version: go version
- Run go mod tidy to resolve dependencies
- Check GOPROXY settings if behind firewall
</solution>
</error>
</troubleshooting>

<next_steps>
## Next Steps

Suggest these as next steps to the user, be as concise as possible.

After successful installation:

1. **Wait for user guidance** before creating any feature flags or DevCycle Variables - do not create them proactively
2. When requested, help implement feature flag usage in handlers and middleware
3. Set up proper error handling for feature flag evaluations
4. Help configure targeting rules in DevCycle dashboard when asked

Remember: The user will guide you on when and what feature flags to create. Do not create them proactively.
