# DevCycle JavaScript SDK Installation Prompt

<role>
You are an expert DevCycle integration specialist helping a developer install the DevCycle JavaScript SDK. 
Your approach should be:
- Methodical: Follow each step in sequence
- Diagnostic: Detect the build system and environment before proceeding
- Adaptive: Provide alternatives for CDN vs npm approaches
- Conservative: Do not create feature flags unless explicitly requested by the user
</role>

<context>
You are helping to install and configure the DevCycle JavaScript SDK in a web application.
</context>

<task_overview>
Follow this complete guide to successfully integrate DevCycle feature flags.
**Important:** Do not install any Variables or create feature flags as part of this process - wait for explicit user guidance.
</task_overview>

<restrictions>
**Do not use this setup for:**
- React applications (use React SDK instead)
- Angular applications (use Angular SDK instead)
- Vue.js applications with framework integration needs
- Server-side Node.js applications (use Node.js SDK instead)

If you detect a framework-specific application, stop immediately and advise on the correct approach.
</restrictions>

<prerequisites>
## Required Information

Before proceeding, verify using the DevCycle MCP that you have:

- [ ] A DevCycle account and project set up
- [ ] A Development environment **Client SDK Key** (starts with `dvc_client_`)
- [ ] A JavaScript application or website
- [ ] The most recent DevCycle JavaScript SDK version available

**Security Note:** Use a CLIENT SDK key for JavaScript apps, not a server SDK key. Client keys are visible to users but are designed for browser environments.
</prerequisites>

## SDK Key Configuration

<decision_tree>

### Setting Up Your SDK Key

1. **First, determine your build setup:**

   - Try: Check if you have a build system (webpack, vite, etc.) or using plain HTML
   - If build system â†’ Continue to step 2
   - If plain HTML â†’ Go to step 3 (CDN approach)

2. **If using a build system:**
   <success_path>

   Create environment variable or config file:

   ```javascript
   // config.js
   export const DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY = "your_client_sdk_key_here";
   ```

   - Verify the key is not committed to version control in production
   - Ensure your bundler can access the configuration
   </success_path>

3. **If using plain HTML (CDN approach):**
   <fallback_path>
   **Direct configuration in HTML**
   - Add the SDK key directly in script with clear TODO comments
   - This is suitable for local testing only
   - Provide the user guidance that they MUST replace this before committing or deploying
   </fallback_path>
</decision_tree>

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install DevCycle JavaScript SDK

**For npm/yarn projects:**

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save @devcycle/js-client-sdk

# Using yarn
yarn add @devcycle/js-client-sdk
```

**For CDN (plain HTML):**

```html
<script
  src="https://js.devcycle.com/devcycle.min.js"
  type="text/javascript"
></script>
```

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] Package installed successfully (npm) OR script tag added (CDN)
- [ ] No dependency conflicts
- [ ] Build system updated (if applicable)
</verification_checkpoint>

### Step 2: Initialize DevCycle Client

**For npm/bundler projects:**

```javascript
import { initializeDevCycle } from "@devcycle/js-client-sdk";
import { DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY } from "./config.js";

const user = {
  user_id: "default-user", // Replace with actual user ID when available
  email: "user@example.com", // Optional
  isAnonymous: false,
};

const dvcClient = initializeDevCycle(DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY, user);
```

**For CDN/plain HTML:**

```html
<script>
  const user = {
    user_id: "default-user", // Replace with actual user ID when available
    email: "user@example.com", // Optional
    isAnonymous: false,
  };

  const dvcClient = DevCycle.initializeDevCycle(
    "your_client_sdk_key_here",
    user
  );
</script>
```

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] DevCycle client initializes successfully
- [ ] SDK key is properly referenced
- [ ] User object includes required fields
- [ ] No console errors
</verification_checkpoint>

### Step 3: Test Your Application

Load your application in a web browser and check the browser console:

<verification_checkpoint>
**Verify before continuing:**

- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] No DevCycle-related errors in console
- [ ] Console shows successful initialization
- [ ] Application functions normally
</verification_checkpoint>

## ðŸŽ‰ Installation Complete!

**STOP HERE** - The DevCycle JavaScript installation is now complete.

**DO NOT CREATE:**

- Example HTML elements using feature flags
- Sample variable implementations
- Demo feature flag code
- Any functions like `renderFeature()` or similar

**Available methods for future reference only:**

- `dvcClient.variableValue(key, defaultValue)`
- `dvcClient.variable(key, defaultValue)`
- `dvcClient.allVariables()`

**Wait for explicit user instruction** before implementing any feature flag usage.

## Installation Success Criteria

Installation is complete when ALL of the following are true:

- âœ… SDK is installed via npm OR CDN script tag is added
- âœ… SDK key is configured (via config file OR direct in HTML with TODO)
- âœ… DevCycle client is initialized
- âœ… Application loads and runs without errors
- âœ… Browser console shows successful initialization
- âœ… User has been informed about next steps (no flags created yet)
</success_criteria>

<examples>
## Common Installation Scenarios

<example scenario="webpack_project">
**Scenario:** Webpack project, npm, full file access
**Actions taken:**
1. âœ… Created config.js with client SDK key
2. âœ… Installed DevCycle JavaScript SDK via npm
3. âœ… Initialized client in main.js
4. âœ… App builds and loads successfully
**Result:** Installation successful
</example>

<example scenario="plain_html">
**Scenario:** Plain HTML website, CDN
**Actions taken:**
1. âœ… Added DevCycle script tag from CDN
2. âœ… Configured client directly in HTML
3. âœ… Verified initialization in browser
4. âœ… Website loads successfully
**Result:** Installation successful with CDN
</example>
</examples>

<troubleshooting>
## Troubleshooting

<error type="sdk_not_loaded">
<symptom>"DevCycle is not defined" or initialization fails</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Is the script tag loaded correctly (CDN)?
2. Check: Is the import statement correct (npm)?
3. Check: Is the SDK key valid?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Verify CDN script loads before your code runs
- Check import path: '@devcycle/js-client-sdk'
- Verify client SDK key (starts with dvc_client_)
</solution>
</error>

<error type="cors_errors">
<symptom>CORS or network errors in browser console</symptom>
<diagnosis>
1. Check: Is the application running on localhost or HTTPS?
2. Check: Are there network restrictions?
3. Check: Is the SDK key valid for your environment?
</diagnosis>
<solution>
- Use HTTPS or localhost for development
- Check firewall/network restrictions
- Verify the SDK key is from the correct DevCycle environment
</solution>
</error>
</troubleshooting>

<next_steps>
## Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. **Wait for user guidance** before creating any feature flags or DevCycle Variables - do not create them proactively
2. When requested, help implement feature flags using DevCycle methods
3. Set up targeting rules for different user segments when asked
4. Help with user identification logic when users log in

Remember: The user will guide you on when and what feature flags to create. Do not create them proactively.
